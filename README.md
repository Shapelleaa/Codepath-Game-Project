## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [*] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ *] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [* ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ *] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [* ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [* ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ *] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)

- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [ I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [While trying to complete the project and tasks I faced a mental challenge. I found out about the CodePath.org internship twenty – four hours before the deadline. Initially, I was so excited about finding an internship opportunity I didn’t realize that I had to submit more than an application. Immediately, after reading the instructions for the application process I noticed I had to code an entire game, submit essays and even record an interview in only twenty-four hours. I panicked. I thought to myself there’s no way I’d be able to have this entire process completed. I thought this is going to be so difficult considering I don’t have much knowledge in HTML or JavaScript coding. However, I refused to let the opportunity pass me without at least trying. I refused to be my own downfall. So, I spent my entire night trying my best to focus and execute the instructions that were given to me so I can create my project. During the process, I was frustrated because there were times when my project wouldn’t do what it was supposed to do, and I had no idea why. I mean I would change and rewrite certain codes several times, but my game still wouldn’t work. However, in the end I overcame it all. I reminded myself why I was applying in the first place. I know my dream is to become a software engineer and to get there I need all the experience I can get. So, instead of doubting myself I put my faith over fear and I got to coding. I ignored whatever negative thoughts came about and I pushed and pushed until I eventually got it right and that’s exactly what I did. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [Some questions I have about web development are:  Why isn’t there a way for the program to inform you about where or why the coding input is wrong? I felt like the coding process would be much easier for everyone if we knew what the exact problem of our code is instead of guessing what is right or wrong. Another question I have is how do web developers know exactly what to put in their code? Especially those developers that make huge apps like Facebook or snapchat?  I’ve always wondered how they knew which function or tag to add in their program to make the apps run like they do now. My final question is why is the code in the program so easily affected? If I missed a comma the entire program doesn’t function. Why is that? And is there any way to avoid that? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would have added more features. I would have loved to add more game buttons and a ticking clock. I think it would’ve made the game more entertaining and it would’ve been more challenging for myself. It would’ve given me the opportunity to learn more about the coding languages and that’s also what I’m looking for when I apply for internships. However, this process provided me a lot of information about the language, and I’m very appreciate for it.  Also, if I had more time on the project, I would’ve spent more time trying to perfect my gifs but I did the best as I could. Finally, if I had more time, I would’ve also spent more time constructing my own conditional statements. However, the research for the ifs and else tags would’ve required some more time. ]
